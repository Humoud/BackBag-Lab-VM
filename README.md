# BackBag Lab\VM

BackBag Lab\VM, small enough to carry on your back (Back**pack**) üéíüíª

## Background & Purpose
I needed a way to quickly setup a small environment that allows me to test both, blue and red teaming related stuff on my laptop üíª. There are also times where I just need an ubuntu server or a win10 instance with a specific set of tools and not a whole environment. This project caters for such cases.

## Design
This project uses Vagrant and a collection of powershell\bash scripts to provision and configure VMs.

#### VMs

Windows base images are from [DetectionLab](https://github.com/clong/DetectionLab). Many thanks to them ‚ô•.

| VM Name  | OS                  |
| -------- | ------------------- |
| WINSRV01 | Windows Server 2016 |
| WINSRV02 | Windows Server 2016 |
| WIN01    | Windows 10          |
| NIX01    | Ubuntu 20.04        |


#### Available Environment Configurations

| VM       | AD Server | Join to Domain | IIS Web Server | Standalone |
| -------- | --------- | -------------- | -------------- | ---------- |
| WINSRV01 | ‚úÖ        | ‚ùå             | ‚ùå             | ‚úÖ         |
| WINSRV02 | ‚ùå        | ‚úÖ             | ‚úÖ             | ‚úÖ         |
| WIN01    | ‚ùå        | ‚úÖ             | ‚ùå             | ‚úÖ         |
| NIX01    | ‚ùå        | ‚ùå             | ‚ùå             | ‚úÖ         |

‚úÖ = You can enable this setup for the VM.
‚ùå = Setup not available.

**AD Server:** VM can be promoted to a Domain Controller.

**Join to Domain:** VM can be joined to domain. Requires a machine with setup "AD Server" to be available.

**IIS Web Server:** IIS Web Server can be installed on the VM.

**Standalone:** VM can be created and used without requiring any other VM to exist. Note that "Join to Domain" feature can not be used when using a VM in standalone setup.
